# Recent Project Involvement  

**R&D: Backoffice Process Automation with AI Agents**  
Augmenting backoffice team throughput by using LLMs and machine learning enabled document intelligence solutions to validate incoming reward claims against uploaded proof of purchases. Performed prompt engineering to utilize structured outputs, function calling. Currently designing a secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that can enable LLMs to perform tasks depending on context. 

**Fraud Detection and Monitoring**
Reward promotions pay out cash or award gift incentives to customers that purchased a qualified product. A fraud score is calculated for incoming reward claims by observing emerging patterns based on:  
* Request Origin IP address
* Time of day (higher risk for claims submitted outside of business hours)
* Browser capabilities (incognito, fingerprint)
* Navigation patterns (claim submission completion time)
* Similarity to recently received claims
  * Purchases from same reseller
  * Timing of claims from same geographical location
* Fulfillment information (beneficiary bank account, gift delivery addresses)
* Validity of attached electronic proof of purchase (file metadata, file hash)

**Data Lake for Power BI**  
Developed automation to regularly extract data from transactional systems using SQL, export into Parquet, and uploaded to Azure Data Lake Storage to build Power BI reports.  

**Promotion Analytics and Reporting**
A complete re-think of how business units get up-to-date information on reward promotion performance.  On-going feature discovery and iterative prototyping.
*  **Current System:** Reports are generated in Excel on a schedule, sent to promotion contacts
*  **Problems:** 
   * Business contacts have different reporting needs, non-standard promotions require significant implementation effort
   * Reports for promotions with a lot of participants are too large to be sent via e-mail
*  **Solution:** Give business units access to a new web-based reporting system where 
   * Promotion administrators can:
     * Conveniently copy and customize KPI dashboards from existing promotions
     * Grant business contacts on a range of relevant promotions that they own
     * Monitor usage to get an insight of new reports or KPIs that can be introduced to business contacts
   * Business contacts can:
     * See promotion KPIs at a glance
     * Drill-down key data dimensions to claim level
     * Schedule regular export of claim data to Azure Data Lake Storage for use in their own Power BI dashboards  

**Loyalty Platform Re-architecture**
Breaking down monolithic web application to separate promotion content distribution from customer accounts. Introduce a build step to generate static HTML out of dynamic content that used to be fetched, evaluated, and written to responses for each HTTP request. Use a CDN to distribute and fetch and cache whole or partial HTML content.  Introduce and develop microfrontends for dynamic parts (such as showing customer account balances and transaction history)
